# Stopwatch Web Application

This web application is a simple stopwatch designed to help users track time accurately. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to use and deploy on any web browser.

## Features:
1. Start: Initiates the stopwatch, allowing the user to track elapsed time.
2. Pause: Temporarily halts the stopwatch without resetting the elapsed time.
3. Reset: Resets the stopwatch, setting the elapsed time back to zero.
4. Laps: Records the current elapsed time as a lap, allowing users to track multiple intervals.

## Usage:
1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. Click on the "Start" button to initiate the stopwatch.
3. To pause the stopwatch, click on the "Pause" button.
4. Clicking on the "Reset" button will set the elapsed time back to zero.
5. To record laps, click on the "Lap" button. Each lap will be displayed below the stopwatch with the corresponding elapsed time.

## Implementation:
- The stopwatch functionality is implemented using JavaScript's `setInterval()` function to update the elapsed time every second.
- Event listeners are used to handle user interactions such as starting, pausing, resetting, and recording laps.
- CSS is utilized for styling to enhance the user interface and provide a visually appealing experience.

## Improvements:
- Add the ability to save laps or export them for future reference.
- Incorporate visual indicators for lap times or split times.
- Implement settings to customize the stopwatch display or sound notifications.
